# Vanilla Boilerplate Theme

This repo is intended to be used as a boilerplate to create themes for Vanilla framework.

## How to use this boilerplate

1. Import this repo into your newly created repo for your new theme. It should be named `vanilla-*-theme` where `*` is the unique name of your theme.

2. Edit the `package.json` file to update the relevant name and repo details.

3. Update `_theme.scss` and `build.scss` to include the name of your new repo.

4. Run `npm i` to install the necessary dependancies.

5. Run `gulp test` - if everything is setup correctly, your console should not return any errors or warnings. Happy theming!
